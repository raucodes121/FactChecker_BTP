Project Description
Welcome to our project where technology meets the humanities, providing a unique lens through which we explore the realm of political speeches and media responses. Our endeavor delves into the intricate dynamics between public discourse and media coverage, offering insights across multiple disciplines.

Overview:
-Exploration: We embarked on a journey to dissect political speeches and media reactions, embracing a tech-driven approach. Fuelled by our collective curiosity, we sought to uncover hidden truths within the world of political communication.

-Efficient Data Collection: Leveraging our technical expertise, we efficiently collected speech transcripts and media articles. Our data retrieval process was optimized to ensure comprehensive coverage and depth of analysis.

-Emotion Analysis: We harnessed the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the NRC-Emotion-Lexicon dataset to dive into the emotional undercurrents of political speeches and media narratives. This emotional analysis helps shed light on the sentiment and tone surrounding these pivotal moments in public life.

-Media Bias Detection: A core focus of our project was to unearth instances of media bias. By systematically comparing various media outlets' responses to the same speeches, we aimed to identify and quantify potential biases that can shape public perception.

Achievements:
-Our project has received an 'A' grade, signifying the maximum level of excellence and competence in its execution.

Technologies and Frameworks:
-Python: Python served as the backbone of our project, providing the flexibility and power necessary for data analysis and manipulation.

-Numpy: We employed NumPy for efficient and high-performance data manipulation, ensuring that our analyses were both precise and speedy.

-Pandas: The heart of our data processing and organization was powered by Pandas, allowing us to handle complex datasets with ease and precision.

-Matplotlib and Seaborn: These powerful data visualization libraries enabled us to present our findings in visually engaging and informative ways.


Our project represents a harmonious blend of technology, data analysis, and humanities. It offers a valuable perspective on the nuanced relationship between political speeches and media responses. We invite you to explore the depth of our work, gain insights into the multifaceted world of public discourse, and appreciate the power of data-driven analysis in understanding our society.
